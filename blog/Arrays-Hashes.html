      <h1>Arrays vs Hashes</h1>
        <p> "A hash gives you a key value pair.  You can think of a hash as a collection of pairs of information, and each pair is made of a name and a value. 
		The name is called a key, and it must be unique. You use the key to return the value paired to it. </p>

       <p> dias = { "Monday" => "lunes", "Tuesday" => "martes", "Wednesday" => "mercoles" } </p>

        <p>Arrays have indexes, which arent exactly keys. They are jsut lists. It starts at zero, and is numbered. Just a collection of data in some kind of order. 
		You can look up a piece of data by using the number it comes in on the list, </p>

        <p> days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"]</p>

        <p> Compare and Contrast : You should use you each one? You would use an array for a list, such as integers, etc. You would use a hash for a lsit that should return a matching pair, such as username and password. </p>
