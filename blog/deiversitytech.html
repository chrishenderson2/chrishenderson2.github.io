      <h1> Diversity in the Tech Industry </h1>




        <p>I decided to cover the issue of diversity in tech. As you may know, there isn’t a lot of it in the industry, which is a huge problem. Tech jobs are some of the highest paid, however, most tech employees are white  males. Females, Latinos, and African Americans are disproportionately left out of the tech industry.) </p>

 

        <p>While the break down in the united states of males to females is almost 50-50, companies such as Microsoft, Salesforce, and Intel’s gender breakdown shows only a maximum 30% of their workforce are women. Ndivia hires only 16% women, with the rest being male. Pandora is a pioneer in this issue, with 49% of their workforce being women.</p>

 

        <p>The statistics for racial minorities are much lower. Latinos make up 16% of the US population, and African Americans make up another 12%. However, for many of the major social networks (Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, google+, Instagram, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Flickr, and Youtube), the highest percentage of latinos working at any one of those companies is 4%. For African americans, the highest percentage is 2%. At google, one of the most influential of tech companies, says it welcomes and promotes diversity. However, only 3% and 2% of their workforce is Latino and Black, respectively. Yet both these groups have high graduation rates from colleges with computer science and engineering degrees. Why is it that they aren’t being hired?</p>

 

 

        <p>Some solutions include better inclusion programs in companies for minorities and women. Diversity boards, retreats, specialized and targeted open houses, and trainings for women and minorities would greatly enhance the interest from those groups in the tech industry. Since the stats are so low, many of us believe there is no place for minorities and women in the work place. Tech companies should take special initiative, something like Affirmative Action, to get these groups of people empowered and in positions of importance in tech companies.</p>
